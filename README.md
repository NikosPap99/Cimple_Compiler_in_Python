# Cimple_Compiler_in_Python

A compiler for the educational Cimple programming language. The compiler is written in Python, does lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and produces intermediate code, C code that corresponds to this intermediate code and also machine-level code. I have provided some file examples written in Cimple programming language to test the code on. The compiler provides clear error messages when the syntax of the programs is wrong.

The compiler script takes the .ci file as command line argument.
